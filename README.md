# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

I created an ice cream store and the reason why I chose this was because we had previously practicted a lot of code related to Desserts. My store included an Ice Class, Container Class, and a Scoops Class. I represented my Ice Class using flavor, price, and cone or no cone. Container Class was described using weight and brand of ice cream. Scoops Class used number of Scoops. Based on the user's input all the details would be shown through the toString() method. All of the user's responses would be stored as the variables previously stated and would then create an object related to the class and output the selected ice cream details. For example, a user can ask for 2 scoops of strawberry ice cream in a Haagen Dazs container through the Scoops Class.
